# Flex Day Assignment

Your assignment is in the assignment.py file. You need to replace all of the pass keywords with the answers to the problems.

Each function should end with the return keyword. Here is an example

```
def generate_easy_math_problem:
    return "1 + 1"
```

when you think you have solved the problem correctly, type pytest in the terminal and press enter.

```
pytest
```

It will show you what tests you passed and which are still failing. Keep working until all tests pass.

When you are done, click on the version control button and

1. Stage the changes (click on the plus)
2. Add a commit message
3. Commit the changes
4. Synch the changes
